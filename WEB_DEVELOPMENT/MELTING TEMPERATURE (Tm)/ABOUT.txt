Basic Melting Temperature (Tm) Calculations

Two standard approximation calculations are used.

For sequences less than 14 nucleotides the formula is:
Tm= (wA+xT) * 2 + (yG+zC) * 4

where w,x,y,z are the number of the bases A,T,G,C in the sequence, respectively.

For sequences longer than 13 nucleotides, the equation used is
Tm= 64.9 +41*(yG+zC-16.4)/(wA+xT+yG+zC)
